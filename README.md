🏦 Bayt AlMal Bank System (C++)

A fully functional, console-based banking system written in modern C++. The application allows users (e.g., bank employees) to manage client records — including adding, updating, deleting, searching, and displaying clients. All client data is saved to a plain text file (BankUser.txt).

This is perfect for beginners looking to learn C++ file I/O, vector manipulation, console formatting, and struct-based data modeling.
